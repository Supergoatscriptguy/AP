                    <p>Sirius, also known as the Dog Star, is the brightest star in the night sky. Located in the constellation Canis Major, Sirius is actually a binary star system consisting of Sirius A and a faint white dwarf companion, Sirius B.</p>
                    
                    <p>Due to its intense brightness, Sirius has been a prominent fixture in the night sky throughout human history. Its name comes from the Greek word "seirios," meaning "scorching" or "glowing," which reflects its dazzling appearance.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="star-quick-facts">
                        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> A-type main-sequence star (A1V)</li>
                        <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 8.6 light-years</li>
                        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> About 1.7 times the Sun's diameter</li>
                        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 2.02 solar masses</li>
                        <li><strong>Luminosity:</strong> 25.4 times brighter than the Sun</li>
                        <li><strong>Surface Temperature:</strong> 9,940 K</li>
                        <li><strong>Age:</strong> 200-300 million years</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Sirius appears so bright in our sky not only because it's intrinsically luminous but also because it's relatively close to our solar system, being one of our nearest stellar neighbors.</p>

                    <p>Sirius is a binary star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. The discovery of Sirius B was a significant achievement in astronomical history.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Components of the Sirius System:</h3>
                    <ul class="star-facts-list">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Sirius A:</strong> A main-sequence star about twice the mass of our Sun and 25 times more luminous</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Sirius B:</strong> A white dwarf star that was once more massive than Sirius A but has shed its outer layers</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Orbital Period:</strong> The two stars orbit each other approximately once every 50 years</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Separation:</strong> They are separated by about 20 astronomical units (AU) on average</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Sirius B is a fascinating object in its own right. Despite having about the same mass as our Sun, it has collapsed to roughly the size of Earth. This means its material is incredibly denseâ€”a teaspoon of its matter would weigh about 5 tons on Earth.</p>
                    
                    <p>The binary nature of Sirius was first predicted by Friedrich Bessel in 1844 based on wobbles in Sirius A's motion. Sirius B was first observed in 1862 by Alvan Clark, confirming Bessel's hypothesis.</p>

                <ul class="star-facts-list">
                    <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Ancient Egypt:</strong> The heliacal rising of Sirius (when it becomes visible just before sunrise) coincided with the annual flooding of the Nile, marking the beginning of the Egyptian new year</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Ancient Greece and Rome:</strong> The appearance of Sirius in summer was associated with the "dog days" of intense heat</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Polynesian Navigation:</strong> Used as an important navigational star by Polynesian voyagers</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Dogon People:</strong> The Dogon tribe of Mali reportedly had knowledge of Sirius B before its scientific discovery, which has been a subject of controversy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The term "dog days of summer" comes directly from Sirius's position in Canis Major (the Greater Dog) constellation. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, Sirius rises and sets with the sun, adding its heat to our star's and supposedly contributing to the hottest days of the year.</p>

                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Stellar Evolution:</strong> Perhaps Sirius has changed over the past 2,000 years (considered unlikely)</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Atmospheric Effects:</strong> Ancient observers might have seen Sirius when it was low on the horizon, making it appear red due to atmospheric scattering</li>

                    <h3>Stellar Evolution Timeline:</h3>
                    <ul class="star-facts-list">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Present:</strong> Sirius A is a main sequence star with about 200-300 million years of age</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i> <strong>Future Main Sequence:</strong> Will continue fusing hydrogen for approximately 500-600 million more years</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The future red giant phase of Sirius A will likely have significant effects on its orbit with Sirius B. Their orbital dynamics will change as Sirius A loses mass, potentially leading to a wider separation between the two stars.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sirius is currently approaching our solar system and will reach its closest point in about 60,000 years, when it will appear even brighter in Earth's night sky. After that, it will gradually recede as our relative motions carry us apart again.</p>
